            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I have been working on this website on and off as I continue to learn more about web programming.
              I feel pretty confident about CSS and HTML now. But, I still have to work on JavaScript. I know a little
              bit of the basics, but I am still not sure how it works together yet.</p>
              <p>Hopefully as I learn more, I can continue to add more and more stuff to this website. Let me know what you think!</p>
